This is the first assignment of the module IOS at FIT. It is a shell script, that helps with managing and editing files in your linux file system. You can use for example to edit the last edited file in your current folder (with your favourite text editor), or you can display all the files, that have been edited between selected dates. It has many options for listing files, such as sorting them by the amount of edits and so on.
